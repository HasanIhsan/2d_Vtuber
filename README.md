## Project Name

This project is basically a prototype for a PNG v-tuber program. 

> once when I was scrolling through YouTube I saw someone use a PNG v-tuber, where when the person talked the image would change from a not-talking state to a talking state, and I though, I wonder if I can make that, and here we are.

2. Things to note:
	1. there are alot of bugs I still need to fix. (like crashes, nulls, image sizes, etc)
	2. this is a very work in progress project...
	3. I plan on updating the UI and making it look nicer when I have all the ideas and features I want implemented.
	4. honestly this is just a side project, while i’m looking for a job, you might as well look for a finished product XD.
